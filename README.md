GameDialogXMLEditor
==================
There is a game scenario editor,It can be used to write game scenario.You can create new XML Document with specific format by it,or read and edit specific format XML by it.I create it due to my new mobile game(Unity3D),XML Document.For cutting down the capacity of final document,                                                                         Thank You
